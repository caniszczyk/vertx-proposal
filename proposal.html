<p>This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and
scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse
community. Please send all feedback to the 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/forums/eclipse.proposals">Eclipse Proposals</a>
Forum.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<!-- 
	Optionally provide the background that has lead you to creating this project.
 -->

<p>
Vert.x is the framework for the next generation of asynchronous, effortlessly scalable, concurrent applications.
</p>
<p>
TODO talk about vert.x history 
</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>
Vert.x is an event driven application framework that runs on the JVM - a run-time with real concurrency and unrivalled performance. Vert.x then exposes the API in Ruby, Java, Groovy, JavaScript and Python. So you choose what language you want to use.
</p>

<p>
Future applications will largely be running on mobile and embedded devices. These demand a platform that can scale with 10s, 100s or even millions of concurrent connections, and allow developers to write scalable, performant applications for them incredibly easily, in whatever language they prefer.
</p>

<p>
We believe Vert.x is that platform.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe the project here. Be concise, but provide enough information that
	somebody who doesn't already know very much about your project idea or domain
	has at least a fighting chance of understanding its purpose.
 -->

<p>
Vert.x is the framework for the next generation of asynchronous, effortlessly scalable, concurrent applications.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Vert.x is polyglot. Write your application components in JavaScript, Ruby, Groovy, Java or Python. It's up to you. Or mix and match several programming languages in a single application.</li>
<li>Vert.x has a super simple concurrency model. Vert.x allows you to write all your code as single threaded, freeing you from the hassle of multi-threaded programming. (No more synchronized, volatile or explicit locking).</li>
<li>Unlike other popular event driven frameworks, Vert.x takes advantage of the JVM and scales seamlessly over available cores without having to manually fork multiple servers and handle inter process communication between them.</li>
<li>Vert.x has a simple, asynchronous programming model for writing truly scalable non-blocking applications.</li>
<li>Vert.x includes a distributed event bus that spans the client and server side so your applications components can communicate incredibly easily. The event bus even penetrates into in-browser JavaScript allowing you to create effortless so-called real-time web applications.</li>
<li>Vert.x provides real power and simplicity, without being simplistic. No more sprawling xml configuration files.</li>
<li>Vert.x includes a module system and public module repository, so you can easily re-use and share Vert.x modules with others.</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Why Eclipse?</h2> 

<!-- 
	Answer these two questions:	What value does this project bring to the Eclipse
	community? What value do you expect to obtain from hosting your project at Eclipse?
	
	What value do you get by having your project at Eclipse over and above the value
	of hosting at Eclipse Labs?
 -->

<p>

</p>

<h2>Initial Contribution</h2>

<!-- 
	Projects are expected to arrive at Eclipse with existing code.
	
	Describe the existing code that will be contributed to the project. Please provide
	a couple of paragraphs describing the code with modest detail, including important
	information like code ownership (who holds the copyright?), and some consideration
	of community that exists around the code. Include a listing of third-party libraries 
	and associated licenses.
 -->
 
<h2>Legal Issues</h2>

<!-- 
	Please describe any potential legal issues in this section. Does somebody else
	own the trademark to the project name? Is there some issue that prevents you
	from licensing the project under the Eclipse Public License? Are parts of the 
	code available under some other license? Are there any LGPL/GPL bits that you
	absolutely require?
 -->

<p>
Talk about VMWare project history etc...
Talk about the requirement for the project to be licensed under the APL.
</p>

<p>
VMWare is transfering the existing trademark to the Eclipse Foundation.
</p>
 
<h2>Committers</h2>

<!-- 
	List any initial committers that should be provisioned along with the
	new project. Include affiliation, but do not include email addresses at
	this point.
 -->

<p>The following individuals are proposed as initial committers to the project:</p>

<ul>
        <li>Tim Fox, Red Hat (lead)</li>
        <li>Somebody else, Affiliation</li>
</ul>

<p>We welcome additional committers and contributions.</p>

<!-- 
	Describe any initial contributions of code that will be brought to the 
	project. If there is no existing code, just remove this section.
 -->

<h2>Mentors</h2>

<!-- 
	New Eclipse projects require a minimum of two mentors from the Architecture
	Council. You need to identify two mentors before the project is created. The
	proposal can be posted before this section is filled in (it's a little easier
	to find a mentor when the proposal itself is public).
 -->

<p>The following Architecture Council members will mentor this
project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Chris Aniszczyk</li>
	<li>John Arthorne</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interested Parties</h2>

<!-- 
	Provide a list of individuals, organisations, companies, and other Eclipse
	projects that are interested in this project. This list will provide some
	insight into who your project's community will ultimately include. Where
	possible, include affiliations. Do not include email addresses.
 -->

<p>The following individuals, organisations, companies and projects have 
expressed interest in this project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Chris Aniszczyk, Twitter</li>
	<li>Somebody else, Affiliation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Scheduling</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe, in rough terms, what the basic scheduling of the project will
	be. You might, for example, include an indication of when an initial contribution
	should be expected, when your first build will be ready, etc. Exact
	dates are not required.
